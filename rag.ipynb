      "a. Revenue recognition\n",
      "The Group’s contracts with customers include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues from customer contracts are\n",
      "considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved, in writing, by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are\n",

      "Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts\n",
      "over a specified period. Revenue from fixed price maintenance contract is recognized ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of\n",
      "benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of the contract because the\n",
      "services are generallydiscrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the\n",

      "The Group's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions.\n",
      "Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax\n",
      "positions.\n",
      "Inassessingtherealizabilityofdeferredincometaxassets,theManagementconsiderswhethersomeportionorallofthedeferredincometaxassetswillnotbe\n",
      "realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the\n",
      "temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income\n",
      "and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the\n",
      "periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will realize the benefits of those deductible\n",
      "differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable\n",
      "income during the carry forward period are reduced (Refer to Notes 2.15).\n",
      "c. Business combinations and intangible assets\n",
      "Business combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103, Business Combinations. Ind AS 103 requires the identifiable intangible assets and contingent\n",
      "consideration to be fair valued in order to ascertain the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. These valuations\n",
      "are conducted by external valuation experts. Estimates are required to be made in determining the value of contingent consideration, value of option\n",
      "arrangements and intangible assets. These measurements are based on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and\n",
